## [h2] When to use

-   What problem does this solve?
    
-   The situations in which a component or pattern should be implemented
    

## [h2] What to avoid

-   Describe any exceptions or situations where we know something will not work
    
-   If known, include what to use instead (workarounds and solutions) - logic has to be clear
    

## [h2] Content and design

### [h3] Content specifications

-   ## Include any labeling or content considerations or requirements
    
-   This is so content designers know what the guardrails are
    
-   Describe correct layout
    

### [h3] Design specifications

-   ## Technical specifications - mostly CSS
    
-   This is for non-dev designers to be able to recreate in their asset libraries (This may include design tokens if we move forward with that idea)
    

### [h3] Visual examples

-   Working coded examples if possible
    
-   Flat images if necessary
    
-   Include mobile view
    
-   Include variants
    
-   Include clear titles for each visual examples, long descriptions, alt text, and captions if necessary
    

## [h2] How to implement

-   ### Describe how to implement - this is about the code or technical implementation (as CMS agnostic as possible)
    
-   This may include numbered steps to follow
    

### [h3] Implementation resources

-   Links to any WET/GCweb, Drupal WxT, CDTS, AEM, etc. resources that exist
    
-   Link to the part of such documentation that relates specifically to the pattern if possible
    
-   ## [GCweb (WET) theme](https://wet-boew.github.io/GCWeb/docs/implementing-en.html): Variables, parameters and working examples
    
-   ## [Drupal WxT](https://drupalwxt.github.io/en/docs/environment/)
    
-   ## [AEM/Managed Web Service (accessible only on the Government of Canada network)](https://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/AEM_GC-specific_Documentation_6.5) (Keep the GC network info within the link tab so screen readers know that this link requires access to the network)
    
-   ## [Centrally deployed templates solution](https://cenw-wscoe.github.io/sgdc-cdts/docs/internet-en.html)
    

-   ## [CDTS Samples](https://cdts.service.canada.ca/app/cls/WET/gcweb/v4_0_45/cdts/samples/) - provides links to sample pages that demonstrate how to implement various CDTS features
    

### [h3] Code

Include a code snippet, don’t copy and paste code

## [h2] Research and rationale

-   Summarize the research that supports this component or pattern, and how it was tested
    
-   Include known issues and gaps
    
-   Related blog post(s) behind a component or pattern to help build trust - include the description used in DTO newsletter with each blog post link  
    Example:
    

-   [Using task success to improve user experience](https://blog.canada.ca/2022/03/23/task-success): Evidence from the GC Task Success Survey can help support positive cultural change within your organization.
    

## [h2] Latest changes

-   Include enough detail to be useful in understanding the changes that were made…don’t simply say, “Expanded guidance”
    
-   Reverse chronological order
    
-   3 most recent visible
    
-   Additional changes within an expand/collapse labeled “Previous changes” (tentative idea)
    

Example:

----------

Button

----------

YYYY-MM-DD  Created a new contextual Sign in Button pattern
