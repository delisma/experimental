<p>The Digital Transformation Office recently carried out a wayfinding project to investigate shortcomings people found with the global menu.  On the one hand, the global menu cannot manage more complex navigation needs that some institutions require.  On the other, some institutions find that the global menu’s elaborate navigation structure gets in the way of adopting the Canada.ca design.  These limitations are frustrating because web analytics show that visitors to Canada.ca hardly ever use the menu.</p>

<p>Our wayfinding project investigated the experience of how people found what they were looking for on Canada.ca by examining users engaged in specific tasks.  The research included a baseline study to discover and assess findability problems and comparison study to come up with solutions.   Our findings have directed changes to the Canada.ca ca design.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Canada.ca homepage update</strong>: the content section of the Canada.ca homepage will include heavily used footer links.  This will make it possible to remove the links from the global footer.</li>
  <li><strong>Contextual Sign in button</strong>: the global header will have an option for an exposed sign in button that can be placed on a relevant page or pages.</li>
  <li><strong>Global footer updates</strong>: menu links will be moved to a main band and a contextual band will be available for specific links related to a page or group of pages.</li>
  <li><strong>Menu button to be retired</strong>: the menu button can be removed when web analytics show that it is used less than 1% of the time.</li>
  <li><strong>Theme page updates</strong>: the theme page template will be updated to help guide people to specific themes by providing straightforward access to top tasks.</li>
</ol>
<p>It seems like a lot of work!  Not to worry.  We are taking a transitional approach to change.   We’ll take small steps to cover a large distance over time, but first let’s have a look at the research that informed our design decisions.</p>
<h2>The Wayfinding Project</h2>
<p>The goal of the Wayfinding Project is to make it easier to adopt the Canada.ca design, make sign-in interactions more obvious, and improve theme navigation.  Our approach is to explore the performance of different designs and follow that up with an assessment of the global navigation with a single-site design.</p>
<h3>2019 Baseline study</h3>
<p>The 2019 Baseline study examined the performance of the Canada.ca design with sites using different designs from four institutions.   This was a moderated, task-based study with 20 participants.   It laid the groundwork for developing a prototype for the comparison study.</p>
<h3>2021 Comparison study</h3>
<p>The 2021 Comparison study of Canada.ca’s global navigation focussed on how users navigate between different top-level pages when using the same site to complete a task.  This was a moderated, task-based study with 18 participants.   Research and prototyping explored options to remove the menu while maintaining or improving the effectiveness of global navigation.  We also wanted to preserve the confidence and trust we’ve established with the Canada.ca site brand.</p>
<p>Our prototype design included the following design elements for testing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a global header without a menu</li>
  <li>theme links from the menu were placed in the footer</li>
  <li>a sign in button was placed in the global header</li>
  <li>a layered theme template was created</li>
</ul>
<h3>Research discoveries</h3>
<p>One of our main discoveries was that task success was not decreased when the menu button was removed.   Task success for internal institution pages remained consistent with the performance of pages with a menu and there was even an improvement for finding top tasks on Canada.ca.  A significant reason that task success remained constant is that breadcrumbs are used more than the menu for navigation.</p>
<p>When the Sign in button was placed at the conventional top-right of the global header it was used with a high degree of success.   In fact, when the menu button is used in our current design on sites that require authentication, people use it to search for a way to sign in.  Signing in is a top task on Canada.ca!  Exposing the Sign in button deflated the use of the menu.  This observation confirmed that the beloved menu button can be retired.</p>

<h2>Applied research: a transitional approach to change</h2>
<p>We are using a transitional approach to make these design improvements to our navigation.  Some of the work has already been done so you can start making changes.  Other facets are still on the Canada.ca design horizon, but we are strategically focused on them.  This is our roll-out plan.</p>
<h3>1. Updates to our Canada.ca homepage</h3>
<p><span class="fas fa-check mrgn-rght-md text-success" aria-hidden="true"></span> Done</p>
<p>Heavily used links in the global footer have been moved to the content section of the Canada.ca homepage.  Check it out.</p>

  <div class="panel-body">
    <ul class="mrgn-tp-md">
      <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en.html">Canada.ca homepage</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
<h3>2. Contextual Sign in button</h3>
<p><span class="fas fa-check mrgn-rght-md text-success" aria-hidden="true"></span> Available to use</p>
<p>The global header now includes the contextual Sign in button.  It is an optional element to be used on a page or pages where people are likely looking to sign in to an account.  It is important to consult your analytics to confirm that signing in is a main task.  Use the Sign in button in combination with the menu button at first.  It may seem a bit redundant, but this is part of the transition to retire it.</p>

<h3>3. Update your footer</h3>
<p><span class="fas fa-circle mrgn-rght-md text-warning" aria-hidden="true"></span> Available very shortly</p>
<p>The new Global footer is made up of three content bands.</p>
<h4>Contextual-footer band</h4>
<p>The contextual band is optional and configurable.  This is your band.  You can provide up to three contextual support links that are relevant to a page or groups of pages’ content.  If you already have a contextualized contact link on your site, you will need to configure your contextual band.</p>
<p>Use at your discretion, but bear in mind that these links are mostly used as rescue links, often a last resort for frustrated searchers.  Don’t make the contextual band part of your navigation strategy!</p>
<h4>Main-footer band</h4>
<p>The main band is mandatory on standard pages and optional on Transactional and Campaign pages.  It’s not configurable.  The menu’s  themes and topics links will be moved here.  This change will happen “automatically” for people using the Adobe Experience Manager.   Other implementations will have to be updated accordingly.</p>
<h4>Sub-footer band</h4>
<p>The Sub footer band is mandatory on all pages and it’s not configurable.  It contains the Canada wordmark and corporate links to “Social media,” “Mobile applications,” “About Canada.ca,” “Terms and conditions,” and “Privacy”. (support links + wordmark)</p>

      <li>Design system: <a href="#">Global site footer</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
<h3>4. Remove the menu button</h3>
<p><span class="fas fa-circle mrgn-rght-md text-info" aria-hidden="true"></span> Available in the near future</p>
<p>If you have updated your footer and home page, added sign in where required, and your analytics show that the menu button is used less than 1%, then you can retire the menu button.</p>
<h3>5. Layered theme design</h3>
<p><span class="fas fa-circle mrgn-rght-md" aria-hidden="true"></span> Still a ways off</p>
<p>The Layered theme page template will replace the theme template.   It is currently being developed and tested to help people move through different themes by providing easy access to top tasks.  It will include a widget to help people navigate across themes and provide Alert capabilities.  Also, the features section and social media links will be removed because analytics show that they are rarely used.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Stay tuned!  This is a transitional process that will take some time to complete.</p>
<p>We are continuing to conduct research and analysis to improve navigation and brand trust.   There are always areas that can be improved and new challenges will arise as we transition to these new patterns.  Share your experience with us: the good, the bad, and the ugly!  Ask us how you can participate in research.</p>
