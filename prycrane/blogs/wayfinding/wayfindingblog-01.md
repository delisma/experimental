title: "The Wayfinding Project: a strategy to improve Canada.ca navigation"
description: 
  en: The wayfinding study investigated issues with Canada.ca navigation and informed changes to improve navigation and simplify the adoption of the Canada.ca design for departments and agencies.  The main improvements include the introduction of a new sign in button, removing the menu button, a contextual footer band, a main footer band with themes, and a layered design for the theme page.

 <p>The DTO recently carried out a wayfinding project to investigate shortcomings of the global menu.  On the one hand, the global menu cannot manage more complex navigation needs that some institutions require.  On the other, some institutions find that the global menu’s elaborate navigation structure gets in the way of adopting the Canada.ca design.   These limitations are frustrating because web analytics show that visitors to Canada.ca hardly ever used the menu.</p>

  <p>Navigation is about wayfinding, you can't treat it as separate because many other things run parallel with it. If you look at studies in wayfinding, everything from exhibit design to building the cathedrals, it's about creating a complete system. It's about looking at the whole.</p>

  <p>– Clement Mok</p>

  <p>Wayfinding research included a task-based baseline study to examine the problems and comparison study to come up with some solutions.   Our findings have directed changes to the Canada.ca ca design.</p> 
  
  <ul>
<li><strong>Contextual Sign in button</strong>: the global header will have an option for an exposed sign in button that can be placed on a relevant page or pages.</li>
<li><strong>Canada.ca homepage update</strong>: the content section of the Canada.ca homepage will include heavily used footer links.  This will make it possible to remove the links from the global footer.</li>
<li><strong>Menu button to be retired</strong>: the menu button can be removed when its use is reduced to less than 1%.</li>
<li><strong>Contextual footer band</strong>: pages that already have a contextual contact us link will be able to include it and two other pertinent items in the new footer.</li>
<li><strong>Updates to the layered theme page</strong>: the theme page template will be updated to help guide people to specific themes by providing straightforward access to top tasks.</li>
  </ul>
<p>This seems like it’s going to take a significant effort to make these changes.  Not to worry.  We are taking a transitional approach.   We’ll take small steps to cover a large distance over time, but first let’s have a look at the research that has guided our design decisions.</p>
