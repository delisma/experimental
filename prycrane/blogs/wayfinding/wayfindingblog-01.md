description: 
  en: The wayfinding study investigated issues with Canada.ca navigation and informed changes to improve navigation and simplify the adoption of the Canada.ca design for departments and agencies.  The main improvements include the introduction of a new sign in button, removing the menu button, a contextual footer band, a main footer band with themes, and a layered design for the theme page.

 <p>The Digital Transformation Office recently carried out a wayfinding project to investigate shortcomings people found with the global menu.  On the one hand, the global menu cannot manage more complex navigation needs that some institutions require.  On the other, some institutions find that the global menu’s elaborate navigation structure gets in the way of adopting the Canada.ca design.   These limitations are frustrating because web analytics show that visitors to Canada.ca hardly ever use the menu.</p>

  <p>Navigation is about wayfinding, you can't treat it as separate because many other things run parallel with it. If you look at studies in wayfinding, everything from exhibit design to building the cathedrals, it's about creating a complete system. It's about looking at the whole.</p>

  <p>– Clement Mok</p>

  <p>Wayfinding research included a task-based baseline study to examine the problems and comparison study to come up with some solutions.   Our findings have directed changes to the Canada.ca ca design.</p> 
  
  <ul>
<li><strong>Contextual Sign in button</strong>: the global header will have an option for an exposed sign in button that can be placed on a relevant page or pages.</li>
<li><strong>Canada.ca homepage update</strong>: the content section of the Canada.ca homepage will include heavily used footer links.  This will make it possible to remove the links from the global footer.</li>
<li><strong>Menu button to be retired</strong>: the menu button can be removed when its use is reduced to less than 1%.</li>
<li><strong>Contextual footer band</strong>: pages that already have a contextual contact us link will be able to include it and two other pertinent items in the new footer.</li>
<li><strong>Updates to the layered theme page</strong>: the theme page template will be updated to help guide people to specific themes by providing straightforward access to top tasks.</li>
  </ul>
<p>This may seem like it’s going to take a significant effort to make these changes.  Not to worry.  We are taking a transitional approach.   We’ll take small steps to cover a large distance over time, but first let’s have a look at the research that has informed our design decisions.</p>


<h2>The Wayfinding Project</h2>
  
 <p>The goals of the Wayfinding Project are to increase the adoption of the Canada.ca design, make sign-in interactions more obvious, and improve theme navigation.  Our approach was to explore the performance of different designs and then follow that up with an assessment of the global navigation on a single-site design.</p>

<h3>2019 Baseline study</h3>
<p>The 2019 Baseline study examined the performance of the Canada.ca design with sites with different designs from four institutions.   This was a moderated, task-based study with 20 participants.   It laid the groundwork for developing a prototype for the comparison study.</p>
<h3>2021 Comparison study</h3>
<p>The 2021 comparison study of canada.ca’s global navigation focussed on how users navigate between different top-level pages when using the same site to complete a task.  This was a moderated, task-based study with 18 participants.   Research and prototyping explored options to remove the menu while maintaining or even improving the efficacy of global navigation.  We also wanted to preserve the confidence and trust we’ve established with the Canada.ca site brand.</p>

<p>Our prototype design included:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a global header without a menu</li>
<li>theme links from the menu were placed in the footer</li>
<li>a sign in button was placed in the global header</li>
<li>a layered theme template was created</li>
</ul>	
<h3>Research discoveries</h3>
<p>One of our main discoveries was that task success was not decreased when the menu button was removed.   Task success for internal institution pages remained consistent with the performance of pages with a menu and there was even an improvement for finding top tasks on Canada.ca.  The reason task success remained constant is that breadcrumbs are used more than the menu for navigation.</p>

<p>When the Sign in button was placed at the expected top-right of the global header it was used with a high degree of success.   In fact, when the menu button is used in our current design on sites that require authentication, people use it to search for a way to sign in.  Exposing the Sign in button completely deflated the use of the menu.  This observation confirmed that the beloved menu button can be retired.</p>
