**From: [Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat.html)**

These are the rules to create web content that can be easily found, understood and used. They are based on writing principles and techniques that help make web content clear and adapted to the needs of all people. Use it with the Canada.ca Content and Information Specification when you're designing and organizing web content.

## Purpose

This guide establishes the rules you must use to develop and edit English web content that will be published on a Government of Canada website. The rules are different from practices adapted to print to support principles related to accessibility, readability and usability.

The purpose of these rules is to make web content easy to find, easy to understand and easy to use for everyone, including people who have physical or cognitive disabilities.

The techniques described in this guide complement the rules set out in The Canadian Style. If there are conflicts between this guide and The Canadian Style or any other resource, this guide takes priority for content published online.

As web and language trends evolve, we'll update this guide to meet the changing needs of our audiences.

## Use of the style guide
This style guide is referenced in the Directive on the Management of Communications. The requirements apply to departments and other organizations of the federal public administration listed in Schedules I, I.1 and II of the Financial Administration Act.

These organizations must follow this style guide's requirements for all public-facing websites and digital services, regardless of the technology, domain name or publishing platform used.

### Out-of-scope situations
Institutions that fall outside of Schedules I, I.1, and II of the Financial Administration Act do not have to follow this style guide. However, all institutions are encouraged to use it for both their internal and external web products. Following this guide's rules and techniques will make it easier for everyone to find, understand and use the government's digital content.

## Related policies, standards and procedures
Content must comply with:
* templates, content components, character limits and other requirements as described in the Canada.ca Content and Information Architecture Specification
* requirements set out in the related legislated and policy instruments, including:
  * [_Policy on Communications and Federal Identity_](#)
  * [_Directive on the Management of Communications_](#)
  * [_Standard on Web Accessibility_](#)
  * [_Standard on Web Interoperability_](#)
  * [_Standard on Optimizing Websites and Applications for Mobile Devices_](#)
  * [_Guidance on Publishing in the Government of Canada_](#)
  * [_Procedures for Publishing_](#)
  * [_Official Languages Act_](#)

## 1.0 Writing principles for web content
The rules in this guide reflect how people read and use web content.

### 1.1 Help people complete tasks
Most people come to a government website to complete a task and expect us to provide information that will help them. Tasks can be:

* transactional (submit a form or download a report)
* informational (find out how to collect a benefit or find a phone number)

People trying to complete a task online usually don't read word by word. They scan quickly for words and links related to what they want to do.

Government of Canada web content must be:

* **intuitive**: give people who have no previous knowledge of the topic or process just enough information to complete a task on their own
* **comprehensive**: give the appropriate details to specialists who have more knowledge of a topic or process
* **targeted**: present the most important information first, in a way that is tailored to the needs of the audience, instead of giving all the options and leaving people to figure out which ones apply to them
* consistent: use a standardized approach so that people can scan content quickly and easily with a sense of confidence and trust

### 1.2 Consider the needs of the audience
When planning web content, consider people's needs. Make sure that the content is accessible, clear and adapted to the widest audience.

#### Writing for accessibility
Making content accessible means a wide range of people can use it, including people with physical and cognitive disabilities (for example, reading disorders, attention deficit disorders, memory disorders).

To make your content accessible, consider how assistive technologies work and how some writing practices may impact people's ability to read or understand text. Remember to also refer to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0.

#### Writing for inclusivity
Make gender-inclusive writing your standard practice. Avoid references to gender whenever possible.

For more guidance, including how to write inclusively in French, see the Translation Bureauâ€™s Gender-inclusive writing: correspondence.

#### Writing for readability
Readability is the ease with which a person can read and understand a text. Readable content means better task completion and higher client satisfaction.

To make your content readable, consider your audience's reading level and literacy needs. Not everyone reads at the same level or understands content in the same way. Even when content is presented clearly and simply, people who have low literacy levels and other difficulties can find it hard to understand text.

According to Statistics Canada (2012) and Canadian literacy organizations, almost 50% of Canadians have literacy challenges. Research shows that people with literacy challenges:

* spend a lot of time trying to understand words that contain more than two syllables
* read word by word and slowly move their eyes across each line of text
* skip over large amounts of information when it contains many multi-syllable words, uncommon terms and long sentences

Techniques for improving and measuring readability are in the section on plain language.

#### Writing for specialized audiences
Sometimes, your content targets people who have in-depth knowledge of a subject.

When writing for a specialized audience, you can use terms they're familiar with, even if those terms aren't familiar to a general audience.  Include a summary in plain language for:

* people who aren't familiar with the subject
* specialists who might be scanning the content to decide whether it's relevant to their task

#### Consider all screen sizes
People will view your content on different sizes of screens. Phone and tablet screens display less content than desktop and laptop screens. Readers who use small screens:

* have to go through more steps to access the same amount of information
rely on their short-term memory to recall information that isn't visible on the screen
