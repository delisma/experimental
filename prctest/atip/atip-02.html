      <li>1. What are the costs involved when submitting a request under the <cite>Access to Information Act</cite> or <cite>Privacy Act</cite>?</li>
    </summary>
    <p>Under the <cite>Privacy Act</cite>, there are no associated costs as it is your personal information that you are requesting.</p>
    <p>Under the <cite>Access to Information Act</cite>, there is an initial $5.00 processing fee which covers the first 5 hours of search and preparation for your request. If more than 5 hours of search and preparation is needed for a request, a fee estimate will be calculated and you will be advised on the additional costs, which is $10.00 for every hour of research and preparation beyond the first 5 hours. Furthermore, you may be charged photocopy fees which are $0.20 a page for large requests, but again, you will be notified of any such additional costs in advance.</p>
    <p>To avoid additional costs to your Access to Information request, please make sure that you describe, in great detail, the information that you are seeking. The more general and/or broad your request is, the more likely there will be additional fees attached to it.</p>
